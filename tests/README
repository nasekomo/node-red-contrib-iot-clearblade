# Running the tests
We can run the tests by executing `npm tests`.

We can run an individual test by running `mocha [JS_FILE]`.

# Preparing the tests
In order to run some of the tests, GCP resources are expected to exist.  The `terraform` directory
contains terraform scripts for creating these resources.
