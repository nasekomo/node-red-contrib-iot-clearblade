# BigQuery Insert
![BigQuery Insert Node](images/bigquery_node.png)

The BigQuery insert node performs insertion of new rows into the table.  The `msg.payload` contains either a single object or an array of objects that are to be inserted into the table.

The node passes through the input message unchanged.
